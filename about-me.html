                    <p class="article-body"><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that
                         I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
                    <p class="article-body">
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't
                        hold a relationship. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="article-title">How I turned things around</h3>

                    <p class="article-body"> <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of 
                        everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a 
                        smaller apartment, and I quit my job. </p> 
                    <p class="article-body">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such
                            a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p> 

                    <h3 class="article-title">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                    <p class="article-body">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, 
                        enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                        </p>
                    <p class="article-body">With how much it turned my life around,<strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start 
                        sharing how I did it</strong> , and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I 
                        started this site! </p>
